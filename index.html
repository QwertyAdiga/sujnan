      <div>
        Vision of Sujnan Educational Trust is based on hard work, open communication, a strong emphasis on teamwork and high level
        of responsibilities. This visionary culture allows and emphasizes our wards not only to adapt the present day challenges but
        also to acknowledge their individual responsibilities to the society and our nation at large. The physical, intellectual,
        spiritual, social and psychological formation received in one's school/college speaks volumes about the individual and the
        institution.
      </div><br>
      <div>
        It has been observed that the majority of students who clear NTSE, NEET, JEE, KVPY, NDA, CA and CS are from North India as 
        they are given training to face these exams right from their primary education. This kind of training is lacking in 
        Karnataka, causing students to lag behind in these competitive exams here. With the dream of introducing qualitative training
        to the students at the primary school level, we have introduced IIT/NEET foundation classes from 6th standard in our
        institution. We have established Sujnan Pre-University College in the serene ambience of Yadadi-Mathyadi in Kundapura. Our
        utmost focus lies in the holistic development of our students by giving importance to their talents in sports, art and culture, 
        along with education, and creating a sense of responsibility towards the community at large.
